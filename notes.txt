I chose to implement the scrabble solver + 

1. Allow user to specify blank tiles as part of their rack
2. Support a user-supplied word list
3. My own feature, which I chose to be: "allow user to supply a pattern match all solutions against"

TODO:
- The permutation code in the solve function might be able to be factored out into a separate function
- pattern matching currently takes regular expressions as an input. It might be more user friendly to
create some sort of DSL that gets translated into appropriate regexes.
